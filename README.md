TBX-Samples
===========

We will try to collect as many TBX samples as possible into this repository for testing purposes. To prevent duplication, however, TBX files in other repositories are not included here. See the locations listed below for more TBX samples.


* [p5-mt2tbx](https://github.com/byutrg/p5-mt2tbx)- see the `sample_data` folder
* [TBX-Basic Package](https://github.com/byutrg/TBX-Basic-Package)- includes `TBX-basic-sample.tbx`
* [Microsoft Terminology Collection](http://www.microsoft.com/Language/en-us/Terminology.aspx)- TBX-Basic term bases used by Microsoft to localize their applications in over 120 languages.

If you'd like more information on the available dialects and how to check term bases for validity, please see [TBX-Spec](https://github.com/byutrg/TBX-Spec).
